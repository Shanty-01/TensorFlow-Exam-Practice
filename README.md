# TensorFlow Exam Practice

This repository contains practice cases for the TensorFlow Developer certification from Dicoding.

## Submission Structure

The repository includes three submission folders, each containing five types of problems:

1. **Linear Model Creation**
   - Build a simple linear model to map input arrays (X) to output arrays (Y).
   - Utilizes a single dense layer for model implementation.

2. **Image Classification**
   - Implement normalization techniques and employ either dense layers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

3. **Image Classification with Transfer Learning**
   - Utilize a pre-trained model (Inception V3) and the `ImageDataGenerator` for labeling and preprocessing image data.

4. **Text Classification**
   - Construct a text classifier using text tokenization and an embedding layer to represent words in a reduced dimensional space.

5. **Time Series Forecasting**
   - Apply windowing techniques to create three-dimensional time series data.
   - Combine 1D convolutional layers, LSTM, and dense layers to build an effective forecasting model.

## Objective

The submitted code meets the passing criteria for the Dicoding TensorFlow Developer certification simulation.
